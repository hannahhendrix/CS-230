The Gaming Room Project

The Gaming Room is a mobile app game developer with notable success with the Android-based competition game Draw It or Lose It. The client desired to create a web-based adaptation of its existing Android application in order to provide the game accessible across a variety of platforms and devices.

In terms of proficiency, I excelled in providing the client with a comprehensive documentation of recommendations. These recommendations took into accout the clients requests, the contraints of the project on various platforms on host Operating Systems, with reagrd to a myriad of qualities. This includes security, benefits of using serverless architecture, API framework, and memory/sotrage management.

The most helpful process that was implememted during this design project includes analyzing the domain model as a UML class diagram. This contributed to my comprehension of the framework and relationships among the elements that represented the application's components. This aided in the development of clear classes with straightforward techniques that directly utilized other entities to form an appealing prototype. 

The element of this project that could benefit the most from a revision is the addition of a singleton pattern within the intial prototype code. A singleton pattern would apadt an ordinary class definition, in order for a single instance of the class to exist in the memory at any given time. 

When developing web-based apps, the user's primary needs are speed as well as usability. Quality elements such as look and feel remain significant but not as much as speed and usability. If a user does not like the look of the application, they can decide to continue utilizing it, yet they are going to abandon it entirely if its performance is confusing or slow. User requirements are of the utmost significance since, as the product's consumers, they serve as the client's primary source of profits.

When creating software, begin ambiguous and gradually work toward precision. Take primary objectives and implement them via various iterations to arrive at the end result.  Technical requirements which define the technical strategy to practical fulfillment can be subdivided from operational demands. The technical specifications are subsequently adapted into proposals for design, architecture, and code which satisfy the criteria and provide the ultimate solution.
